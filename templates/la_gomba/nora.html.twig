		    Nora decided to act on her Climate Grief and started looking for
            solutions that are doing good for the environment and somewhat
            profitable. She wanted to help lowering meat consumption and at
            the same time clean the environment. Months of research has
            started and finally the answer was: A Vienna based company called
            Hut&Stiel that recycles coffee waste and turns it into delicious
            Oyster mushroom. Nora started her internship at the company right
            away.

		    In the 3rd district of Vienna in Markhofgasse there is a coworking
            space full of vibrant people with life and energy. Apart from the
            many people there are many spaces also. At the end of 2019 in one
            of the basements that is not too big and not too small renewal
            working has started. Viennese people like to drink coffee. They
            like to drink coffee a lot and there are thousands of kilograms of
            coffee grounds ending up in the trash day by day.

		    Instead of going to the garbage the daily collected coffee grounds
            go to Hut & Stiel's production site where they are carefully
            turned in to mushroom substrate. The substrate goes in to bags and
            the bags go in to the incubational room. After 3 weeks of
            incubating they go to Nora's basement to fruit and to be
            harvested.
